- 👋 Hi, I’m @Margarita23Viera, a programming enthusiast with a curious mind and a love for new challenges.
- 👀 I’m passionate about learning, and I firmly believe that there’s nothing I can’t master with time and dedication.
      To me, every problem is an opportunity to grow and enhance my skills, which I can then apply to other aspects of my life.
      In addition to programming, I’m also interested in electronics and carpentry. 
- 🌱 Currently, I’m diving into Python through David J. Malan’s course, “CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python.”
      This course has been highly effective in accelerating my learning journey.
- 💞️ I’m actively seeking collaboration opportunities.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email at margaritarocioviera@gmail.com.
